<h1>Web Scraping Research</h1>
<p>I some credit left on my Google Cloud trial and not much time to use it in, so I have set up a server to use for research into web scraping</p>
<p>You may see a hidden link on my website or other websites I manage. These are used to catch web scrapers</p>
<p>I also have a Twitter account that posts these links for the same purpose</p>

<p><b>Please do not click on these links</b>. Your IP address will be logged and will be used in further analysis. If you did accidentally click one of these links, contact me immediately including your IP address and time accessed so I can remove your request from the logs</p>
