<h1>About somebody-on.cc</h1>

<p>You are probably here after clicking on the somebody-on.cc link in my website footer. If you haven't cliked on it already, please do so. Here's the link: <a href="https://somebody-on.cc" target="_blank">https://somebody-on.cc</a></p>

<p>Yeah, it's a rick roll. But why somebody-on.cc? Why not something else?</p>

<p>I wanted a domain that contained the lyrics to another <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_viral_music_videos" target="_blank">viral song</a> and make people think that they would be redirected to the music video of that song</p>

<p>I immediately thought thought of Smash Mouth's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Star_(song)" target="_blank">All Star</a>. (<i><b>somebody-on.cc</b> told me the world is gonna roll me</i>) So I started looking for a domain hack that will be as close as possible to the song lyrics without being too expensive. Unfortunately, somebody-once-told.me was already taken and all other domain hacks that I could think of were too expensive. So that explains why I chose somebody-on.cc</p>

<p>But why register another domain? Why not just do something like rickroll.ndt3.me? Well, the domain will be used for other purposes. Here are the uses of the domain at the time of writing:</p>
<ul>
<li>img.somebody-on.cc (This subdomain is used for image hosting at <a href="https://ratelimited.me/" target="_blank">RATELIMITED.ME</a>. While anyone can add a domain to their service, only users who pay can actually choose who can use a domain they have added. For security reasons, I wasn't going to allow content uploaded by another user to be served on a subdomain of my main domains)</li>
<li>php.rs.somebody-on.cc (This subdomain is a <a href="https://www.projecthoneypot.org/" target="_blank">Project Honey Pot</a> MX donation)</li>
<li>Future services on the domain may include:
<ul>
<li>Monitoring for bots accessing hidden links which will be placed throughout my website</li>
<li>Email spam monitoring</li>
<li>Honeypots</li>
<li>Any other service where I do not want my name to be in the domain name, or where it would be a security risk to host it on my main domains<li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
